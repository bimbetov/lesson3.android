Lesson 3.
1)
- A Fragment has its own lifecycle and receives its own input events.
- When inflating the layout for either a Fragment or an Activity, you can reference the layout as R.layout.layoutname.
2)
- You can use a Fragment in more than one Activity.
- One Activity can have multiple fragments.
- Use the <fragment> tag to define the place in a layout file where a Fragment is to be inserted.
